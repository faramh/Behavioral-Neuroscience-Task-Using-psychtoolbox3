# Behavioral-Neuroscience-Task-Using-psychtoolbox3
In this Project we have implemented behavioral task of visual search in psychtoolbox-3 which can be used for human and animal neuroscience experiments for studying value and memory

For most animals, survival depends on rapid detection of rewarding objects, but search for an
object surrounded by many others is known to be difficult and time consuming. However, there
is neuronal evidence for robust and rapid differentiation of objects based on their reward
history in primates (Hikosaka et al., 2014).We hypothesized that such robust coding should
support efficient search for high-value objects, similar to a pop-out mechanism. To test this
hypothesis, we let subjects view a large number of complex objects with consistently biased
rewards with variable training durations (1, 5, or 30 days). Following training, subjects
searched for a high-value object (Good) among a variable number of low-value objects (Bad)
(Ghazizadeh et al., 2016).
